# xcgui
Go binding of XCGUI.
DirectUI design idea: there is no sub-window in the window, the interface elements are logical areas (no HWND handle, security, flexibility), all UI elements are developed independently (not limited by the system), more flexible implementation of a variety of program interfaces to meet the needs of different users.
